# MyBlogs
A blogging platform built with Python and Django, featuring user authentication, post creation/editing, categorization, tagging, search, and responsive design. Includes commenting and sharing for engagement, with Django’s ORM and admin panel enabling efficient content management and scalability.
# Technologies Used
  1. Django Framework
  Django is the main framework used for backend development.
  Provides robust ORM for database interactions and efficient handling of HTTP requests.
  Key features utilized:
  Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
  Django's built-in admin panel for managing blog content.
  Middleware for secure session and authentication handling.
  2. DataFrame (Pandas)
  Pandas is used for handling and processing data (if needed in your application).
  Ideal for managing CSV/Excel files, filtering data, and creating reports.
  3. PostgreSQL
  PostgreSQL is used as the database for this project due to its:
  Scalability for larger datasets.
  Support for advanced querying.
  Compatibility with Django’s ORM.
  4. Frontend Technologies
  HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the user interface.
  Bootstrap for responsive design.
